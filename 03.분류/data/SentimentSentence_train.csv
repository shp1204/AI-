this is one of the better buffets that i have been to  ,1
i probably would not go here again  ,0
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot  ,1
the worst was the salmon sashimi  ,0
after two i felt disgusting  ,0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible  ,1
went for lunch   service was slow  ,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating  ,0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal  ,1
so in a nutshell  1  the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer  ,0
i'd rather eat airline food  seriously  ,0
sorry  i will not be getting food from here anytime soon    ,0
i love this place  ,1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me  ,0
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste  ,0
service was slow and not attentive  ,0
definitely will come back here again  ,1
service was fine and the waitress was friendly  ,1
the descriptions said  yum yum sauce  and another said  eel sauce   yet another said  spicy mayo    well none of the rolls had sauces on them  ,0
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated  ,1
also  i feel like the chips are bought  not made in house  ,0
as for the  mains   also uninspired  ,0
it was a huge awkward 1 5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat  ,0
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea  ,1
probably not in a hurry to go back  ,0
the turkey and roast beef were bland  ,0
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver  ,0
we've tried to like this place but after 10+ times i think we're done with them  ,0
probably never coming back  and wouldn't recommend it  ,0
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed    not sure if we will go back and try it again  ,0
after 20 minutes wait  i got a table  ,0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth  where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party  ,1
but i definitely would not eat here again  ,0
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it  ,0
great food and awesome service  ,1
we definately enjoyed ourselves  ,1
total letdown  i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee  ,0
say bye bye to your tip lady  ,0
it is worth the drive  ,1
mediocre food  ,0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews  but i'm not inspired to go back  ,0
hot dishes are not hot  cold dishes are close to room temp i watched staff prepare food with bare hands  no gloves everything is deep fried in oil  ,0
i'd say that would be the hardest decision    honestly  all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste  amazing   ,1
it was a drive to get there  ,0
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes  yet still no food  ,0
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm  ,0
an absolute must visit  ,1
this place should honestly be blown up  ,0
the management is rude  ,0
i started this review with two stars  but i'm editing it to give it only one  ,0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored  ,1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor  ,1
now the burgers aren't as good  the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless  ,0
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill  but unfortunately the taste fell flat  way flat  ,0
service is also cute  ,1
i have eaten here multiple times  and each time the food was delicious  ,1
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough  ,0
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special  ,1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked  ,0

needless to say  i won't be going back anytime soon  ,0
i really enjoyed eating here  ,1
high quality chicken on the chicken caesar salad  ,1
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service  ,0
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh  ,0
there was hardly any meat  ,0
the pizza selections are good  ,1
waitress was good though  ,1
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up  ,0
needless to say  we will never be back here again  ,0
on the good side  the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic   a real treat  ,1
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving  and it wasn't that busy  ,0
the chips that came out were dripping with grease  and mostly not edible  ,0
every time i eat here  i see caring teamwork to a professional degree  ,1
if it were possible to give them zero stars  they'd have it  ,0
thus far  have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time  ,1
  really  really good rice  all the time  ,1
i loved the grilled pizza  reminded me of legit italian pizza  ,1
the potato chip order was sad    i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12  ,0
only pros   large seating area/ nice bar area/ great simple drink menu/ the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough  ,1
we won't be returning  ,0
we had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully  ,1
a good time  ,1
i loved it  ,1
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist  ,1
all in all  i can assure you i'll be back  ,1
also there are combos like a burger  fries  and beer for 23 which is a decent deal  ,1
the fries were great too  ,1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure  but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen  ,0

ample portions and good prices  ,1
and the chef was generous with his time  even came around twice so we can take pictures with him   ,1

the food was delicious  our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal  ,1

they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no  ,0
lastly  the mozzarella sticks  they were the best thing we ordered  ,1
